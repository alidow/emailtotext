# Final Pricing & Onboarding Audit

## âœ… All Pricing References Updated

### Current Pricing Structure (Consistent Everywhere)
- **Free**: $0/mo - 10 texts/month, 7-day history, auto-upgrades to Basic
- **Basic**: $4.99/mo ($4/mo annual) - 100 texts/month, 30-day history, $0.055/text overage
- **Standard**: $9.99/mo ($8/mo annual) - 500 texts/month, 90-day history, $0.022/text overage  
- **Premium**: $19.99/mo ($16/mo annual) - 1,000 texts/month, unlimited history, $0.022/text overage

## âœ… Critical Webhook Handlers Added

### Added Missing Handlers
1. **`checkout.session.completed`** - Activates subscriptions after payment
2. **`setup_intent.succeeded`** - Tracks payment method for free plan auto-upgrade

Without these, users would pay but not get activated subscriptions!
