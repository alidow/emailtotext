## Step-by-Step Opt-In Flow

### Step 1: Initial Web Form Consent
**URL:** https://emailtotextnotify.com/get-started

The user visits our website and:
1. Enters their phone number in a clearly labeled field
2. Sees our explicit consent checkbox (NOT pre-checked) with detailed disclosure
3. Must actively check the consent box to proceed

**Exact Consent Language Displayed:**

Email to Text Notifier at the phone number provided above.

• I will receive SMS messages containing forwarded email content that I 
  send to my unique @txt.emailtotextnotify.com address
• Messages will be sent from toll-free number (866) 942-1024
• Message frequency depends on how many emails I forward (typically 10-100/month)
• I will also receive account notifications (usage alerts, billing updates)
• Standard message and data rates may apply
• I can reply STOP to opt-out at any time
• This consent is not required to purchase any goods or services
```

### Step 2: SMS Verification with Embedded Consent
After submitting the form, the user receives an SMS verification code with consent reminder:

**Exact SMS Message:**
```
Email to Text Notifier: Your verification code is 123456. By requesting 
this code, you consent to receive SMS from us at (866) 942-1024. Reply 
STOP to opt-out. Msg&data rates may apply. Expires in 10 min.
```

### Step 3: Final Consent Confirmation

When entering the verification code, users see a final consent confirmation:
```
By entering this verification code, you confirm your consent to receive:
• SMS notifications of emails forwarded to your unique @txt.emailtotextnotify.com address

## Use Case Description

Email to Text Notifier is a **transactional email-to-SMS forwarding service**. Users explicitly opt-in during registration to receive SMS notifications of emails sent to their unique @txt.emailtotextnotify.com address. 

**Key Points:**
- Messages are **user-initiated** (users control which emails forward)
- Service is **transactional** not marketing
- Each user gets a **unique email address** for forwarding
- **Clear boundaries** on message types (forwarded emails + account notifications only)

## Message Volume
- Estimated: 1,000 - 10,000 messages per month across all users
- Per-user average: 10-100 messages per month
- Volume depends entirely on user behavior (how many emails they forward)
