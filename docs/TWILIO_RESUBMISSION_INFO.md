```
Email to Text Notifier is a transactional email-to-SMS forwarding service that allows users to receive important email notifications as text messages. Users explicitly opt-in during registration to receive SMS notifications of emails they choose to forward to their unique @txt.emailtotextnotify.com address.

The service works as follows:
1. Users sign up and receive a unique email address (e.g., 5551234567@txt.emailtotextnotify.com)
2. Users configure their services (GitHub, monitoring tools, etc.) to send alerts to this address
3. We forward these emails as SMS to the user's verified phone number
4. Users control exactly which emails get forwarded - it's entirely user-initiated

This is NOT bulk marketing or promotional messaging. Each message is triggered by the user's own email forwarding choices. We also send account notifications (usage alerts, billing updates) with explicit consent.

All messages require explicit opt-in with clear disclosure of message types, frequency, and opt-out instructions. Users can reply STOP at any time to opt-out.
```

## Important Notes for Resubmission

### Addressing Rejection Code 30513 (Language Unclear)

We have completely redesigned our opt-in language to be crystal clear:

1. **OLD (Rejected):** "I consent to receive SMS messages at this number"
   
2. **NEW (Compliant):** 
   - Explicitly states "I expressly consent to receive text messages from Email to Text Notifier"
   - Specifies toll-free number (866) 942-1024
   - Describes exact message types (forwarded emails + account notifications)
   - States frequency expectations
   - Confirms consent is voluntary

### Key Improvements Made:
- ✅ Business name clearly stated
- ✅ Toll-free number prominently displayed  
- ✅ Message types explicitly described
- ✅ Frequency expectations set
- ✅ "Not required for service" clearly stated
- ✅ Opt-out instructions at every touchpoint
- ✅ Visual prominence with colored backgrounds
- ✅ Three-layer consent verification

6. Submit within 7 days for priority review

## Response to Specific Rejection Reason

**Rejection:** "Opt-in not sufficient: language unclear"

**Our Fix:** We've implemented the clearest possible consent language that:
- Uses the exact phrase "expressly consent to receive text messages"
- Names the business and toll-free number explicitly
- Describes the exact service and message types
- Appears at THREE different points in the user journey
- Is visually prominent with colored backgrounds
- Includes consent reminder in every SMS message

This exceeds industry standards and follows all examples from Twilio's documentation.
