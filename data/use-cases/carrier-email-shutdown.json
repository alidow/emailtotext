      {
        "question": "Why did carriers shut down email-to-text gateways?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Is this really a drop-in replacement?",
        "answer": "Yes! If your code sends emails to 5551234567@vtext.com, you just change it to your-address@emailtotext.io. The phone number goes in the subject or body."

        "question": "How do I migrate hundreds of phone numbers?",
