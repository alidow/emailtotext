## ðŸ”’ Security Note

After you're done setting up GA4, you can re-enable the policy for security:
1. Go back to the organization policy
2. Set it back to "Enforce"
3. The GA4 setup only needs to run once

## Alternative: Keep Policy, Use Workload Identity

If you want to keep the security policy, you can use Workload Identity Federation instead, but it's more complex to set up.

## Need Help?

The policy blocking keys is actually a good security practice. Options:
1. Temporarily disable â†’ create key â†’ re-enable (5 min)
2. Use Workload Identity Federation (more secure but complex)
3. Do the manual GA4 setup from the checklist (15 min)

Choose based on your security requirements!
